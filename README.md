# easy-ML

A personal project built on top of sklearn. Currently just an excuse to build something and have fun, the goal is to create a step by step process to create simple models
and explain the theory in bite size pieces. Inspired by [Simple_Learn](https://pypi.org/project/simple-learn/) as I enjoyed working on the library and I want to improve my 
fundamental knowledge.
